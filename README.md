## In order to connect to the database

As .env.* is added to the .gitignore, so in order to connect to the two database locally, you need to create 2 .env files with environment variables:
* create ```env.development``` file - 
    code inside: ```PGDATABASE=nc_news```;
* create ```env.test``` file -
    code inside: ```PGDATABASE=nc_news_test```
    
And you are good to go!
